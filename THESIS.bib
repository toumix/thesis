Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages. Our work paves the way toward representing quantum neural machine translation, which may demonstrate quadratic speedup and converge faster or reaches a better accuracy over classical methods.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant against errors and inaccuracies when \$\textbackslash eta\$, the probability for an error in a qubit or a gate, is smaller than a constant threshold \$\textbackslash eta\_c\$. This result improves on Shor's result [Proceedings of the 37th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, 1996, pp. 56\textendash 65], which shows how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation when the error rate \$\textbackslash eta\$ decays polylogarithmically with the size of the computation, an assumption which is physically unreasonable. The cost of making the quantum circuit fault-tolerant in our construction is polylogarithmic in time and space. Our result holds for a very general local noise model, which includes probabilistic errors, decoherence, amplitude damping, depolarization, and systematic inaccuracies in the gates. Moreover, we allow exponentially decaying correlations between the errors both in space and in time. Fault-tolerant computation can be performed with any universal set of gates. The result also holds for quantum particles with \$p{$>$}2\$ states, namely, p-qudits, and is also generalized to one-dimensional quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. We estimate the threshold of our construction to be \$\textbackslash eta\_c\textbackslash simeq 10\^\{-6\}\$, in the best case. By this we show that local noise is in principle not an obstacle for scalable quantum computation. The main ingredient of our proof is the computation on states encoded by a quantum error correcting code (QECC). To this end we introduce a special class of Calderbank\textendash Shor\textendash Steane (CSS) codes, called polynomial codes (the quantum analogue of Reed\textendash Solomon codes). Their nice algebraic structure allows all of the encoded gates to be transversal. We also provide another version of the proof which uses more general CSS codes, but its encoded gates are slightly less elegant. To achieve fault tolerance, we encode the quantum circuit by another circuit by using one of these QECCs. This step is repeated polyloglog many times, each step slightly improving the effective error rate, to achieve the desired reliability. The resulting circuit exhibits a hierarchical structure, and for the analysis of its robustness we borrow terminology from Khalfin and Tsirelson [Found. Phys., 22 (1992), pp. 879\textendash 948] and G\'acs [Advances in Computing Research: A Research Annual: Randomness and Computation, JAI Press, Greenwich, CT, 1989]. The paper is to a large extent self-contained. In particular, we provide simpler proofs for many of the known results we use, such as the fact that it suffices to correct for bit-flips and phase-flips, the correctness of CSS codes, and the fact that two-qubit gates are universal, together with their extensions to higher-dimensional particles. We also provide full proofs of the universality of the sets of gates we use (the proof of universality was missing in Shor's paper). This paper thus provides a self-contained and complete proof of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of local noise.},

As `sets equipped with extra structure', these look like very different things, so combining them in a single theory has always seemed a bit like trying to mix oil and water. However, work on topological quantum field theory has uncovered a deep analogy between the two. Moreover, this analogy operates at the level of categories. This chapter focuses on two categories. One is the category Hilb whose objects are Hilbert spaces and whose morphisms are linear operators between these. This plays an important role in quantum theory. The other is the category nCob whose objects are (n \textemdash{} 1)-dimensional manifolds and whose morphisms are n-dimensional manifolds going between these. This plays an important role in relativistic theories where spacetime is assumed to be n-dimensional: in these theories the objects of nCob represent possible choices of `space', while the morphisms \textemdash{} called `cobordisms' \textemdash{} represent possible choices of `spacetime'.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

Consider also a quantum algorithm \$\textbackslash mathcal A\$ such that \$A |0\textbackslash rangle= \textbackslash sum\_\{x\textbackslash in X\} \textbackslash alpha\_x |x\textbackslash rangle\$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of \$X\$, and let \$a\$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if \$A |0\textbackslash rangle\$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running \$A\$, measuring the output, and using \$\textbackslash chi\$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat \$1/a\$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good \$x\$ after an expected number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{a\}\$, assuming algorithm \$A\$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which \$A\$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of \$X\$ and we had a promise that a single \$x\$ existed such that \$\textbackslash chi(x)=1\$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of \$a\$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of \$a\$ is known, we can find a good \$x\$ after a number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{a\}\$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of \$a\$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of \$x\textbackslash in X\$ such that \$\textbackslash chi(x)=1\$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that producen-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasingn, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

  abstract = {Language is the currency of most human social processes. We use words to convey our emotions and thoughts, to tell stories, and to understand the world. It is somewhat odd, then, that so few investigations in the social sciences actually focus on natural language use among people in the real world. There are many legitimate reasons for not studying what people say or write. Historically, the analysis of text was slow, complex, and costly. The purpose of this chapter is to suggest that social scientists in general and social psychologists in particular should reconsider the value of language studies. With recent advances in computer text analysis methods, we are now able to explore basic social processes in new and rich ways that could not have been done even a decade ago. When language has been studied at all within social psychology, it has usually relied on fairly rigorous experimental methods using an assortment of standardized human coding procedures. These works are helping researchers to understand social attribution (Fiedler \& Semin, 1992), intercultural communication (Hajek \& Giles, 2003), and even how different cultures think about time (Boroditsky, 2001).}

  abstract = {We provide conceptual and mathematical foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing (QNLP), and do so in quantum computer scientist friendly terms. We opted for an expository presentation style, and provide references for supporting empirical evidence and formal statements concerning mathematical generality. We recall how the quantum model for natural language that we employ canonically combines linguistic meanings with rich linguistic structure, most notably grammar. In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to combine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with simulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on quantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally QNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar. Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the same advantage. Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the circuit variables to be learned. Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current standards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of Wittgenstein's meaning-is-context.},

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.},

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and in natural language processing (NLP) seem to contradict the above intuition: symbols are fading away, erased by vectors or tensors called distributed and distributional representations. However, there is a strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols, being the first an approximation of the second. A clearer understanding of the strict link between distributed/distributional representations and symbols will certainly lead to radically new deep learning networks. In this paper we make a survey that aims to draw the link between symbolic representations and distributed/distributional representations.

Abstractly speaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical structure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces. In this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear meaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of sentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby meaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure, live in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor product of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each augmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of sentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.},

  abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

In this case, however, gradient based learning methods take too much time. The extremely increased learning time arises because the error vanishes as it gets propagated back. In this article the de-caying error flow is theoretically analyzed. Then methods trying to overcome vanishing gradients are briefly discussed. Finally, experiments comparing conventional algorithms and alternative methods are presented. With advanced methods long time lag problems can be solved in reasonable time.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {In recent years, developments in machine learning had a tremendous impact on Natural  Language Processing (NLP). However, state-of-the-art language models contain  billions of parameters that require vast computational resources for optimization and  capture syntactic rules only from data, which does not allow an extensive analysis  of the underlying logic of language. Hence, to reduce the parameter space of NLP  models and close the gap between logic-based language models and statistical vector  space models, Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark [11] introduce a compound framework  called Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning, based on Lambeks Pregroup  grammar and Quantum Theory.  This thesis investigates applying the Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning  on the word-sense disambiguation task by Kartsaklis, Sadrzadeh, and Pulman  [18]. Different quantum embeddings are evaluated in terms of disambiguation power,  given a matching context. One focus lies on the description of ambiguous words as  mixed states. Mixed states are probabilistic quantum states expressed as density  matrices which entail a lack of knowledge about the underlying system. Empirical  data was gathered from experiments using quantum circuits and classical computations.  We evaluate the performance and discuss the challenges and limitations of the  current quantum computing models. The results confirm the comprehensiveness of  the Compositional Distributional Model of Meaning and show statistical indications  for a richer representation of words by density matrices.},

This paper provides evidence that the addition of a vector disambiguation step prior to the actual composition would be beneficial to the whole process, producing better composite representations. Furthermore, we relate this issue with the current evaluation practice, showing that disambiguation-based tasks cannot reliably assess the quality of composition. Using a word sense disambiguation scheme based on the generic procedure of Sch\"utze (1998), we first provide a proof of concept for the necessity of separating disambiguation from composition. Then we demonstrate the benefits of an ``unambiguous'' system on a composition-only task.},

In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for recommendation systems that has running time \$O(\textbackslash text\{poly\}(k)\textbackslash text\{polylog\}(mn))\$. All known classical algorithms for recommendation systems that work through reconstructing an approximation of the preference matrix run in time polynomial in the matrix dimension. Our algorithm provides good recommendations by sampling efficiently from an approximation of the preference matrix, without reconstructing the entire matrix. For this, we design an efficient quantum procedure to project a given vector onto the row space of a given matrix. This is the first algorithm for recommendation systems that runs in time polylogarithmic in the dimensions of the matrix and provides an example of a quantum machine learning algorithm for a real world application.},

  abstract = {In the mathematical development of recent decades one sees clearly the rise of the conviction that the relevant properties of mathematical objects are those which can be stated in terms of their abstract structure rather than in terms of the elements which the objects were thought to be made of. The question thus naturally arises whether one can give a foundation for mathematics which expresses wholeheartedly this conviction concerning what mathematics is about, and in particular in which classes and membership in classes do not play any role. Here by ``foundation'' we mean a single system of first-order axioms in which all usual mathematical objects can be defined and all their usual properties proved. A foundation of the sort we have in mind would seemingly be much more natural and readily-useable than the classical one when developing such subjects as algebraic topology, functional analysis, model theory of general algebraic systems, etc. Clearly any such foundation would have to reckon with the Eilenberg-MacLane theory of categories and functors. The author believes, in fact, that the most reasonable way to arrive at a foundation meeting these requirements is simply to write down axioms descriptive of properties which the intuitively-conceived category of all categories has until an intuitively-adequate list is attained; that is essentially how the theory described below was arrived at. Various metatheorems should of course then be proved to help justify the feeling of adequacy.},

Classical algorithms for solving such problems typically take time polynomial in the number of vectors and the dimension of the space.

This paper provides supervised and unsupervised quantum machine learning algorithms for cluster assignment and cluster finding.

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

  abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) is at the forefront of great advances in contemporary AI, and it is arguably one of the most challenging areas of the field. At the same time, with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides a new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. Earlier work has already demonstrated a potential quantum advantage for NLP in a number of manners: (i) algorithmic speedups for search-related or classification tasks, which are the most dominant tasks within NLP, (ii) exponentially large quantum state spaces allow for accommodating complex linguistic structures, (iii) novel models of meaning employing density matrices naturally model linguistic phenomena such as hyponymy and linguistic ambiguity, among others. In this work, we perform the first implementation of an NLP task on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits. We encode word-meanings in quantum states and we explicitly account for grammatical structure, which even in mainstream NLP is not commonplace, by faithfully hard-wiring it as entangling operations. This makes our approach to quantum natural language processing (QNLP) particularly NISQ-friendly. Our novel QNLP model shows concrete promise for scalability as the quality of the quantum hardware improves in the near future.},

The language modelling framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics (DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or "semantics") of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing.},

We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current black-box AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are pioneering a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows from previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system.},

Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans\"atze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer.

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden' units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

  abstract = {With near-term quantum devices available and the race for fault-tolerant quantum computers in full swing, researchers became interested in the question of what happens if we replace a machine learning model with a quantum circuit. While such "quantum models" are sometimes called "quantum neural networks", it has been repeatedly noted that their mathematical structure is actually much more closely related to kernel methods: they analyse data in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces to which we only have access through inner products revealed by measurements. This technical manuscript summarises, formalises and extends the link by systematically rephrasing quantum models as a kernel method. It shows that most near-term and fault-tolerant quantum models can be replaced by a general support vector machine whose kernel computes distances between data-encoding quantum states. In particular, kernel-based training is guaranteed to find better or equally good quantum models than variational circuit training. Overall, the kernel perspective of quantum machine learning tells us that the way that data is encoded into quantum states is the main ingredient that can potentially set quantum models apart from classical machine learning models.},

In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with \$2\$-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

The BRNN can be trained without the limitation of using input information just up to a preset future frame. This is accomplished by training it simultaneously in positive and negative time direction. Structure and training procedure of the proposed network are explained. In regression and classification experiments on artificial data, the proposed structure gives better results than other approaches. For real data, classification experiments for phonemes from the TIMIT database show the same tendency. In the second part of this paper, it is shown how the proposed bidirectional structure can be easily modified to allow efficient estimation of the conditional posterior probability of complete symbol sequences without making any explicit assumption about the shape of the distribution. For this part, experiments on real data are reported.},

There has been great progress in the connectionist approach, and while it is still unclear whether the approach will succeed, it is also unclear exactly what the implications for cognitive science would be if it did succeed. In this paper I present a view of the connectionist approach that implies that the level of analysis at which uniform formal principles of cognition can be found is the subsymbolic level, intermediate between the neural and symbolic levels. Notions such as logical inference, sequential firing of production rules, spreading activation between conceptual units, mental categories, and frames or schemata turn out to provide approximate descriptions of the coarse-grained behaviour of connectionist systems. The implication is that symbol-level structures provide only approximate accounts of cognition, useful for description but not necessarily for constructing detailed formal models.},

These hypotheses are shown to be incompatible with the hypotheses underlying traditional cognitive models. The connectionist models considered are massively parallel numerical computational systems that are a kind of continuous dynamical system. The numerical variables in the system correspond semantically to fine-grained features below the level of the concepts consciously used to describe the task domain. The level of analysis is intermediate between those of symbolic cognitive models and neural models. The explanations of behavior provided are like those traditional in the physical sciences, unlike the explanations provided by symbolic models.Higher-level analyses of these connectionist models reveal subtle relations to symbolic models. Parallel connectionist memory and linguistic processes are hypothesized to give rise to processes that are describable at a higher level as sequential rule application. At the lower level, computation has the character of massively parallel satisfaction of soft numerical constraints; at the higher level, this can lead to competence characterizable by hard rules. Performance will typically deviate from this competence since behavior is achieved not by interpreting hard rules but by satisfying soft constraints. The result is a picture in which traditional and connectionist theoretical constructs collaborate intimately to provide an understanding of cognition.},

The technique is a formalization of the idea that a set of value/variable pairs can be represented by accumulating activity in a collection of units each of which computes the product of a feature of a variable and a feature of its value. The method allows the fully distributed representation of bindings and symbolic structures. Fully and partially localized special cases of the tensor product representation reduce to existing cases of connectionist representations of structured data. The representation rests on a principled analysis of structure; it saturates gracefully as larger structures are represented; it permits recursive construction of complex representations from simpler ones; it respects the independence of the capacities to generate and maintain multiple bindings in parallel; it extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it permits values to also serve as variables; and it enables analysis of the interference of symbolic structures stored in associative memories. It has also served as the basis for working connectionist models of high-level cognitive tasks.},

This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text. Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

We further develop a formalism for understanding both classical as well as quantum linguistic problems and phrase them both as a Harmony optimization problem that can be solved on a quantum computer which we show is related to classifying vectors using quantum Boltzmann machines. We further provide a new training method for learning quantum Harmony operators that describe a language. This also provides a new algorithm for training quantum Boltzmann machines that requires no approximations and works in the presence of hidden units. We additionally show that quantum language processing is BQP-complete, meaning that it is polynomially equivalent to the circuit model of quantum computing which implies that quantum language models are richer than classical models unless BPP=BQP. It also implies that, under certain circumstances, quantum Boltzmann machines are more expressive than classical Boltzmann machines. Finally, we examine the performance of our approach numerically for the case of classical harmonic grammars and find that the method is capable of rapidly parsing even non-trivial grammars. This suggests that the work may have value as a quantum inspired algorithm beyond its initial motivation as a new quantum algorithm.},

To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature 574, 505 (2019). We estimate that the sampling task finished by Zuchongzhi in about 1.2 h will take the most powerful supercomputer at least 8 yr. Our work establishes an unambiguous quantum computational advantage that is infeasible for classical computation in a reasonable amount of time. The high-precision and programmable quantum computing platform opens a new door to explore novel many-body phenomena and implement complex quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {We develop a high-performance tensor-based simulator for random quantum circuits(RQCs) on the new Sunway supercomputer. Our major innovations include: (1) a near-optimal slicing scheme, and a path-optimization strategy that considers both complexity and compute density; (2) a three-level parallelization scheme that scales to about 42 million cores; (3) a fused permutation and multiplication design that improves the compute efficiency for a wide range of tensor contraction scenarios; and (4) a mixed-precision scheme to further improve the performance. Our simulator effectively expands the scope of simulatable RQCs to include the 10*10(qubits)*(1+40+1)(depth) circuit, with a sustained performance of 1.2 Eflops (single-precision), or 4.4 Eflops (mixed-precision)as a new milestone for classical simulation of quantum circuits; and reduces the simulation sampling time of Google Sycamore to 304 seconds, from the previously claimed 10,000 years.},

  abstract = {We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural language processing. Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In (Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark, 2010), the authors introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM (Giovannetti,2008) for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd (2012) into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions.},

Here, we demonstrate a superconducting quantum computing systems Zuchongzhi 2.1, which has 66 qubits in a two-dimensional array in a tunable coupler architecture. The readout fidelity of Zuchongzhi 2.1 is considerably improved to an average of 97.74\%. The more powerful quantum processor enables us to achieve larger-scale random quantum circuit sampling, with a system scale of up to 60 qubits and 24 cycles, and fidelity of FXEB=(3.66{$\pm$}0.345)\texttimes 10-4. The achieved sampling task is about 6 orders of magnitude more difficult than that of Sycamore [Nature 574, 505 (2019)] in the classic simulation, and 3 orders of magnitude more difficult than the sampling task on Zuchongzhi 2.0 [arXiv:2106.14734 (2021)]. The time consumption of classically simulating random circuit sampling experiment using state-of-the-art classical algorithm and supercomputer is extended to tens of thousands of years (about 4.8\texttimes 104 years), while Zuchongzhi 2.1 only takes about 4.2 hours, thereby significantly enhancing the quantum computational advantage.},
